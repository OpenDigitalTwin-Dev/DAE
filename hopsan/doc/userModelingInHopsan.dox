\section userModelingInHopsan_CompPortsAndNodes Components, Ports and Nodes
A Hopsan model consists of components. Each component has one or more ports, which can be connected to ports on other components. A connection is represented in the simulation core by a node object, where the simulation variables are stored. If one port is connected to several other ports, all these connections will share the same node object. This means that all ports that are connected also share the same data. A consequence of this is that if two ports are connected, it does not matter from which port a plot is created, it will show the same data.

\section userModelingInHopsan_cqsTypes C, Q and S component types
Hopsan uses transmission line modeling, which means that a model consists of resistive components (Q-type) and transmission line elements (C-type). A Q-type component can never be directly connected to another Q-type component without a C-type component in between. There are also signal components (S-type), used for mathematical calculations.
